# MyBank Corentin LE GUEVEL - IOS2
 
- To ensure that the user is the one starting tha app, he have to enter his id. After his first connection, the id will be stored and he won't have to enter it each time.
- To save the user's data on the phone, I used a library which is encrypting the data https://github.com/netguru/Kissme.
- To hide the API url I used a library to offuscate the strings https://github.com/MichaelRocks/paranoid
