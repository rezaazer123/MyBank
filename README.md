# MyBank Corentin LE GUEVEL - IOS2
 
- To ensure that the user is the one starting the app, he have to enter his id. After his first connection, the id will be stored and he won't have to enter it each time. Any other id will also be rejected, the reset button should be used in order to change the id.
- To save the user's data on the phone, I used a library which is encrypting the data https://github.com/netguru/Kissme.
- To hide the API url I used a library to offuscate the strings https://github.com/MichaelRocks/paranoid
